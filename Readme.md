This is my first homework made in C, I tried to use and understand the principles of a computer's memory, such as pointers, heap and stack, etc...

I hope you enjoy it! ;)

- The program's purpose is to register products and allow the user to, by using remove and add, modify a product's amount;
- Every time a remove is called by the user, he/she should specify one reason for that remove, it could be anything, even if not actually valid;
- At the program's end, it should print on the console all the products registered inside itself;
- It should allow the user to use the UTF-8 characters.

Note: Made on linux.
